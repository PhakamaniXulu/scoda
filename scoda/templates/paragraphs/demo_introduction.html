<p>Development planning and budget projections hinge on accurately anticipating how the population of an area will change. For metropolitan cities these changes have to be anticipated for the city as a whole as well as for its various sub-regions. In South Africa electoral wards are at the heart of budget allocations, development initiatives and revenue generation making it desirable that population projections are available st this level at the very least.</p>

<p>This project seeks to improve the utility and accuracy with which ward level projections have been made. To date, projection methods have reflected those used for countries and population is treated as a product of births and deaths in each area as well as the level of migration to and from these areas. Unfortunately, for South African cities the level of migration between wards is unknown and possibly even unknowable. Instead of modelling ward population on this basis the method employed here rests on the assumption that wards and cities are part of an open system. This means that an increase in, say, life expectancy in a ward may very well result in an increase in population in another ward or city. At the core of this method is projecting past population trends at enumerator area level then recombining these areas to estimate the aggregate impact on wards.</p>

<p>Verification of the resulting projections was sought by examining supplemental data. In addition the supplemental information was examined to see if it could contribute to improving the method. Supplemental data included satellite imagery, voting returns, measures of social media activity and cellphone connectivity. Of all these new sources of data two additional sources proved to be of particular value.</p>

<p>1. The aerial brightness of cities at night is a good reflection of economic activity, traffic densities, level of electrification and thus the presence of populations. By measuring the nighttime light intensity of cities changes in population distribution should, theoretically, be discernible. Ultimately the luminosity of cities proved to be of little value but major changes in nightlight brightness was, in certain circumstances, a reliable indicator of increasing populations. As the nighttime luminosity of cities is constantly measured by satellites this may prove to to be a useful supplement to the method. As the satellite telemetry will be routinely updated it can be used on an ongoing basis to measure population changes. As the 2017 data has not yet been released the 2016 nightlight data was incorporated into this facility and is used to modify the enumerator area level projections.</p>

<p>2. It was anticipated that a strong indication of population changes would come from cellphone activity as would the extent to which people adopted social media. In the absence of the co-operation of the main cellular service providers alternative sources of information reflecting this connectivity were examined. These included the location registration of web browsers, tweets as recorded by twitter users with GPS-enabled phones, cloud-sourced indicators of WiFi activity and cellphone tower location. Each of these sources had their value and all suffer flaws that indicate they are not fit for the purpose intended here. For example, the nighlights data indicated marked population increases in several residential developments of Johannesburg. These developments were confirmed by satellite imagery. Twitter activity, web-browser registrations and measures of wifi and cellphone activity failed to identify these population changes. This failure can be attributed to many factors, however the main issue is that areas become "connected" some time after being populated. Unlike the nightlight data, these measures reflect infrastructure development (like installing cellphone towers or provision of ADSL/fibre services) that  occurs only after the area is already occupied. In other words they better reflect infrastructure than they do population changes per se.</p>

<p>The quest for ways of improving the method (and of verifying the projections) were not confined to innovative sources. An analysis of changes in voter registration patterns proves to be a robust measure of population changes. In this instance voter registration patterns were used to verify the projections methodology rather than to modify the projections themselves. However, as the projection period increases,  voter registration data  will become an increasingly important way to recalibrate the projections made available here. After the next election in 2019 the voter returns can be used to recalibrate the existing model.</p>

<p>Two facilities are presented here. The main facility is the set of enumerator area projections to 2030, aggregated to ward level. An additional facility has this data aggregated to the resolution of the nightlight telemetry data. Users can then select the threshold at which these projections are over-ridden by nightlight-derived values.</p>
