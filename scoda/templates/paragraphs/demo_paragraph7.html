<p>As a rule projections require the use of the most recent data available and are to used to reflect a situation some point in the future. Consequently it is extremely to difficult to verify projections. It will only be possible to ascertain how accurate the projections were some time after the next census. By that time the utility of the projections will have passed. This said, the veracity of the projections may be given by supplementary data like the registration statistics for local government elections. Local government elections (which use the wards as the basis for choosing representatives) were last held in 2011 and 2016. It should be possible to use this data to what extent population projections for 2016 correspond to the population profile as inferred from voter registration statistics.</p>

<p>In a classical ‘gotcha’ there proves to be a poor correlation between the projected ward population and the ward registration figures within any city. enumerator areas This is because, by law, wards have the same number of registered voters thereby ensuring that the proportion of voters in a ward generally approximates the proportion of the population of the ward. Differences between these two proportions arise from age profile differences, the proportion of immigrants that were not entitled to vote and differing propensities of adult citizens to register. Consequently the wards all have similar populations with the differences between wards reflecting these factors rather than discrepancies in population size. The upshot is that the ward population projections cannot be verified by correlating the number of registered voters in each ward in 2016 to the population projected for that ward.</p>

<p>In Johannesburg, for example, there is a statistically significant correlation between registered voters and the projected population estimates. However only a very small proportion of the difference in the number of registered voters can be attributed to changes in the population (population accounts for 6% of the variation in registered voters). Using the unprojected (and thus 'reliable') enumerator areas 2011 statistics 8% of the variance in the number of registered voters could be attributed to differences in the total ward population. This means that the projection model cannot be verified within a municipality when using the 2016 Local Government Election data or, for that matter returns from any other election</p>

<p>Voting districts by contrast differ. Unlike wards, voting districts are defined in a way that facilitates the management of elections and are not required to be the same size. Unfortunately the average voting districts covers a small number of enumerator areas and, given that the design rests on combining an adequate number of enumerator areas, cannot be used to verify the projections.</p>

<p>An alternative verification process is to create artificial ward-sized agglomerations of enumerator areas. These pseudo-wards are not required to be the same size in terms of registered voter populations yet approximate wards in terms of the number of enumerator areas they contain. Using the 2011 data from Johannesburg, as an example, clusters of 32 enumerator areas were arbitrarily combined. The population of these pseudo-wards were then correlated to estimates of the number of registered voters they contained. The relationship was as expected: positive (greater 2011 populations corresponded to more voters registered for the 2011 election), statistically significant (the correlation was not random). Most importantly 69 percent of the variation in the number of registered voters could be explained by the population size in pseudo-wards. The remaining 32% of variation would be accounted for by differences in age profiles, the proportion of non-citizens in the population and differing propensities of adult citizens to register to vote. The 2011 estimates were drawn directly from the census and IEC data and did not, to any extent, rely on projections. The r2 value of 0.69 (i.e. the 69% of variation) sets a benchmark against which the projected estimates could be evaluated.</p>

<p>In 2016 the number of both wards and enumerator areas. The pseudo-wards were accordingly based on agglomerated clusters of 43 enumerator areas. Estimates of the number of registered voters and the 2016 population were made for each pseudo-wards. The 2016 populations were derived from the projections made earlier. Unfortunately a small number of anomalies in the aggregation of registered voters were evident. These anomalies were a product of the aggregation method which resulted in sparsely inhabited industrial areas being allocated registered voters. The anomaly lies with the allocation of registered voters and not in the projected population. When comparing the 2016 values against the 2011 benchmark of 68% the most anomalous outliers were excluded.</p>

<p>The correlation of the registered voters against the projected 2016 population was, once again, to be in the expected direction and statistically significant. Given this, the most important factor was how much of the variation in the number of registered voters in 2016 could be explained by the projected population of 2016. Given the nature of projections it was expected that the projected population would have less explanatory power than the 69% observed in 2011. Reductions in the r2 value would suggest that the projections were departing from the trend implied by voting registration. In fact the r2 enumerator areas value increased slightly to 0.7 (70 percent of the variation in registered voters could be explained by the 2016 population projection). While the increase in not thought to be statistically significant it does affirm that the underlying method appears reliable and, at the very least, conforms to what the IEC data implies.</p>
