<p>The methodology adopted here rests on the ability to project population for sub-national entities for three points in time - namely the 1996, 2001 and 2011 censi. To do this it was necessary to derive reliable 1996 and 2001 population estimates for each enumerator area as they were defined in 2011. Once again "second order polynomial curves" were fit to these points. This curve was then projected and used to derive population estimates for each enumerator area for the period 2012 to 2030.</p>

<p>The projections (inevitably) resulted in some implausible estimates for some, as ward downward sloping projections eventually result in population estimates that are below zero (negative). Conversely the projections based on an increasing trend could result in rapid population growth and, by implication, implausible population densities. For this reason limits are placed on projections. The two basic rules applied were:

    <ol>
        <li>Negative populations are assumed to reflect empty enumerator areas and negative populations were set to zero.</li>
        <li>The population of any area was not allowed to exceed the maximum density of enumerator areas observed elsewhere in that metro. The maximum population density was determined for the main (largest) category of housing type in every ea. The population density for that enumerator area was restricted to the maximum density observed for that housing type elsewhere in that metro. Areas that, for example, were dominated be informal settlement housing were not allowed to exceed the highest density of other enumerator areas dominated by informal areas in that metro. A threshold was similarly set for formal dwellings, flats and other categories of housing.</li>
    </ol>

    Once the projected population reached the threshold area in terms of density the population for the enumerator area was held at that level. The resulting projections were enumerator areas re-weighed to ensure that the sum of the enumerator areas equalled the population projected for the metro. This was simply a question of reweighing each enumerator area population pro-rata.

</p>

<p>Like wards the projections of enumerator area populations gave rise to implausible or, at least, questionable results. However the essence of this method is to aggregate the enumerator areas to wards (or similar level). To determine the ward population the over five thousand enumerator areas in Johannesburg are combined to reflect trends in 130 wards - with an average of 43 enumerator areas in each ward.</p>

<p>Although estimates are made for every enumerator area these are, on their own, unreliable and often misleading. By contrast the aggregated result are treated as reliable and should be verified as such. Unfortunately projections, almost by definition cannot be verified timeously. The next census will be in 2021. Only a year or so after that will new population estimates at ward level become available. Verification of the projections has to be sought elsewhere. One candidate for verification are the returns for voting districts in each city.</p>
