<p>The city population projections are robust and reliably indicate population trends - without calling for details of fertility, mortality and migration rates. The core role of the city level projections is to provide a target for the ward estimates. For any given year the sum of the population in a city's wards has to equal the estimate for the city as a whole.</p>

<p>Given that the city projections are unknown the key question then becomes how the ward population is distributed in each city. The simplest method is to project trends in each ward and calibrate these to ensure they sum to the total of that city.</p>

<p>The objective of this study was to make projections of ward population for the metropolitan areas. The simplest way to do this is to make a linear projection of ward population form the last two censi. Unfortunately this rapidly gives rise to implausible results. For example, some wards become entirely denuded of population and others show massive increases in population and unrealistic population densities. The situation is partly ameliorated by basing the projections on the last three censi (1996, 2001 and 2011). Fitting curves to the three data points (1996, 2001 and 2011) and projecting that trend does not entirely eliminate the tendency to implausible populations. Despite the large sample size the 2016 Community Survey results were not released for sub-metro entities like wards or enumerator areas.</p>

<p>The shortcoming described above can be addressed by treating the wards as aggregations of smaller components, fitting curves to each of the components and enumerator areas aggregating them back to reconstitute ward profiles. The 'components in this instance can be taken to be enumerator areas (a term used here as synonymous with "small area level"). This method results in ward populations being derived from a complex interplay of the constituent components. By doing this no ward can be totally denuded of population unless every enumerator area in that ward has a declining population. Conversely implausibly large ward populations are undermined by rapid growth in some enumerator areas being offset by declining populations in other enumerator areas. The reasonableness of population growth is enhanced when enumerator area populations are themselves limited to reasonable population densities.</p>
