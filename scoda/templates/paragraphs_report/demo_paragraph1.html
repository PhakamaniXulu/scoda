<p>At country level population projections have proved to be relatively reliable and have afforded planners clear indications of what to expect. This is because the main determinants of population change, fertility and mortality rates and the levels of immigration and emigration can be reliably modelled to provide estimates of trends. Implicit in these models is the assumption that, within these parameters, the population of the system is closed. This means, for example, that the fertility rate of a country does not affected the population of neighbours except through immigration and emigration. The national population is depleted by death and emigration and supplemented by births and immigration. It is axiomatic that those born in the country will live there until they die or emigrate.<p>
<p>At sub-national level these assumption no longer hold. Estimates of fertility and migration rates, for example, get progressively less accurate at provincial, municipal and suburb levels. While it is possible to derive estimates of fertility and mortality from demographic profiles (socio-economic characteristics of households, gender and age profiles etc.) migration present a particular problem for modellers. To measure international counts of movements into and out of the country are required. To understand migration between municipalities the flows between every municipality in the country must be quantified. South Africa has 278 municipalities, meaning that over 77 000 different flows have to be measured. Moreover the focus of this study are electoral wards and with 4 392 wards the number of flow permutations rises to almost 20-million.</p>
<p>Although there are ways to decrease the demands on the information the central point is that modelling migration flows at ward level makes near impossible demands on those collating the data. The information required to treat cities or wards as closed systems do not exist and there is little point other than to treat the systems as open. In open systems changes in fertility and mortality in one area can readily impact on adjacent areas or other cities. A change in fertility in ward A can prompt a change in the population of ward B. Consequently knowing the enumerator areas fertility and mortality rates of any part of an open system will reveals little about population changes in that area.</p>
<p>In open systems changes in mortality and fertility rates can result in an increase in the population of the ward population or prompt migration from that ward. Take the example of a household where an aged parent dies. The death may prompt a decline in the population of the ward in which they live or may prompt the household to move to a smaller dwelling which, quite possibly, is in another ward. Another example is given by the desire of many middle class Gautengers to retire on the south coast of kwaZulu-Natal. Increased longevity in Gauteng then results in population increase in kwaZulu-Natal.</p>
<p>Ultimately the need to treat sub-national administrative areas as open ensures that the methods used to make projections in closed systems fail.</p>
